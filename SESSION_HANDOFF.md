# Session Handoff — 2026-03-21 (Mammal Data Upgrade to Homo Sapiens Parity)

**Status: done**
**Branch:** `claude/dazzling-black`
**PR:** #110

## 1. Session Goal
Upgrade all mammal nodes to match the level of detail shown in the Homo sapiens species card (5 facts, 6 tags, funFact, 5 altFacts, 3 links).

## 2. What I Changed

### js/treeData.js — Expanded facts, tags, funFact for 11 mammal nodes
- **6 leaf species** (blue-whale, naked-mole-rat, platypus, orangutan, gorilla, chimpanzee): facts 3→5, tags 3→6
- **5 branch nodes** (mammals, cetaceans, primates, great-apes, hominini): facts +1 each to reach 5, tags expanded to 6, added funFact where missing

### js/speciesData.js — Added/expanded ENRICHMENT entries
- **3 new entries**: mammals, cetaceans, hominini (5 altFacts + 3 links each)
- **4 partial fixes**: naked-mole-rat +1 link, platypus +1 link, primates +1 altFact, great-apes +1 altFact

### Merge conflict resolution
- Merged origin/main which added 5 new mammal species (bottlenose-dolphin, flying-fox, african-elephant, gray-wolf, three-toed-sloth) and restructured tree order
- Resolved 3 conflicts keeping upgraded data + new species
- Removed duplicate naked-mole-rat/platypus entries from old tree positions

# Previous Session Handoff — 2026-03-21 (Timeline Bottom UI Cleanup)

**Status: done**
**Branch:** `claude/kind-euler`
**PR:** #111

## 1. Session Goal
Remove ugly duplicate timeline markers and clean up the bottom UI area.

## 2. What I Changed

### index.html — Deleted `addTimelineMarkers()` (59 lines)
- Removed duplicate `EXTINCTION_EVENTS` array, `INNOVATIONS` array, `addTimelineMarkers()` function, and its `setTimeout` call
- These rendered garish full-height red `#ef4444` lines with `†` daggers and green `#2e7d32` lines with emoji icons directly on `#timeline`
- The proper `buildExtinctionMarkers()` system with CSS classes and hover tooltips remains

### index.html — CSS Fixes
- Removed dead `.ext-line` CSS rule (unused)
- Fixed light theme species count: `rgba(30,80,15,0.6)` → `var(--text-secondary)` for readability

## 3. Merge Resolution
- Merged `origin/main` (1 conflict in extinction marker CSS)
- Main had redesigned markers with `.ext-marker-icon`, `.ext-marker-line`, `.ext-popover` system
- Kept main's new design, applied species count readability fix on top

## 4. Previous Session
- Hominin Pill Chips & Deep Dive Removal (PR #106, `claude/intelligent-payne`)
